I used a Photoshop plugin action to generate these.  Details here:

http://appicontemplate.com/android

Use the illustrator file to create the icon and export the .png

Open the .psd template and go to the edit and save layer, drop the .png there, and then
executed Window->Actions->App Icon Template as per the instructions.

It kicked out all of the files in the App Icon [Squared] directory.  Really, it only
took me the 20 minutes in Illustrator to mock up the png, the rest was less than 5
minutes.

I dropped only the needed files into Xcode, and then associated them with the WoFiOS
AppIcon in the global settings:
