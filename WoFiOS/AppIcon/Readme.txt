I used a Photoshop plugin action to generate these.  Details here:

http://appicontemplate.com/android

Work directory here:

./Work

In that directory you'll find the illustrator file that I used to create the
icon and the exported .png

I then opened the .psd template, and went to the edit and save layer, dropped
the .png there, and then executed Window->Actions->App Icon Template as per
the instructions.

It kicked out all of the files in this directory.  Really, it only took me the
20 minutes in Illustrator to mock up the png, the rest was less than 5 minutes.
